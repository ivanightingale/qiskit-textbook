In fact, the complexity of algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computers is often quoted in terms of how many $T$ gates they'll need. This motivates the quest to achieve things with as few $T$ gates as possible. Note that the discussion above was simply intended to prove that $T$ gates can be used in this way, and does not represent the most efficient method we know."
